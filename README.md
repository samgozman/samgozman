### Hi there 👋

My name is Sam Gozman, 28yo 🇮🇱, speaking in en & ru. I started programming at the age of 12 and have been working full-time as a backend developer since 2016, mainly in the fintech sector. My main programming languages are **Golang**, **TypeScript** and **Rust**. I have been a member of the GitHub open-source community for a long time :)

If you are interested in learning more about me, my OSS projects or reading a dev blog that I've rebuilt recently - I encourage you to visit my website:
