### Hi there 👋
My name is Sam Gozman, 27yo 🇮🇱, speaking in en & ru. I started programming at the age of 12 and have been working full-time as a backend developer since 2016, mainly in the fintech sector. My main programming languages are **Golang**, **TypeScript** and **Rust**. I have been a member of the GitHub open-source community for a long time :)
