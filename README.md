### Hi there 👋
My name is Sam Gozman. Brief information about me:

- 🍼 I started programming at the age of 12. I began with mods for a computer game, then I made my first website for these mods. That's how I got into web development.
- 👨‍💻 I have been officially working as a web developer since 2016. My main bias in development was on CMF MODX.
- 👾 Starting from the end of 2020, I have been working exclusively on backend development on NodeJS / TypeScript (ExpressJS, NestJS etc.)
- 📈 Since 2021, I have been developing open-source software for investors (stock market, value analysis, short sales activity). This includes a [TightShorts](https://tightshorts.ru/) website that structures short sales data in the form of a screener with filters; [Short-Fork](https://short-fork.herokuapp.com/) - is a personal compact assistant in the quick evaluation of the company's financial multipliers and a lot of small public libraries for these projects (+Telegram bots)
- 🗓️ In late 2022 I created my new big [open-source](https://github.com/samgozman/validity.red) project - [Validity.Red](https://validity.red). A web service for managing the expiration dates of documents (passports, travel cards, vaccinations, insurance, etc) and synchronizing them with your calendar. It is written in Go, TypeScript, Vue, and Rust
- 🧑‍🔧 4 years of experience in designing and assembling 3D printers as a favorite hobby (+ working on CO2 laser cutter)
- 🧑‍🔬 3 years of experience in programming and soldering microcontrollers as a hobby (from Attiny13 to NodeMCU)
- 👨‍🎓 My education: 4 years in college as a developer, 4 years of bachelor's degree in "business informatics" at the institute. And a ton of courses on Udemy
- 🌍 My languages: 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇬🇧 English
