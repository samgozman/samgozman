### Hi there 👋
My name is Sam Gozman. Brief information about me:

- 🍼 I started programming at the age of 12. I began with mods for a computer game, then I made my first website for these mods. That's how I got into web development.
- 👨‍💻 I have commercial full-time experience as a developer since 2016.
- 🦀 My main programming languages are Go lang, TypeScript and Rust. I work mainly with PostgreSQL and Redis databases.
- 👾 Starting from the end of 2020, I have been working mostly as a backend developer (90% backend, 10% frontend).
- 🌍 I am speaking in: 🇷🇺 Russian (Native), 🇬🇧 English (B2) and learning Hebrew 🇮🇱.
- 👨‍🎓 My education: Bachelor's degree in "Business informatics and business architecture" and a "Technician programmer" in college. Also, I spend a lot of time on self-education :)
- 📈 I'm interested in fintech, brokers, stocks investments, etc as my main line of work. I have also spent around 4 years designing and assembling 3D printers, working with CO2 laser cutters, and programming & soldering microcontrollers as a hobby 👨‍🏭.

<details>
    <summary>I’m working only on my own OSS projects in this GitHub account. Some of my latest big projects</summary>

  - In late 2022 I created my new big [open-source](https://github.com/samgozman/validity.red) project - [Validity.Red](https://validity.red). A web service for managing the expiration dates of documents (passports, travel cards, vaccinations, insurance, etc) and synchronizing them with your calendar. It is written in Go, TypeScript, Vue, and Rust
  - [Short-Fork](https://short-fork.extr.app) - is a personal compact assistant in the quick evaluation of the company's financial multipliers and a lot of small public libraries for these projects. Recently updated to NestJS, Redis, and VueJS.
  - [TightShorts](https://tightshorts.extr.app) website that structures short sales data in the form of a screener with filters.
  - [YoptaScript](https://github.com/samgozman/YoptaScript) - a real programming language for “gopniks”. It was written in 2016 as a joke but gained popularity in Russia due to its excessive simplicity for poorly educated people with a limited vocabulary.
